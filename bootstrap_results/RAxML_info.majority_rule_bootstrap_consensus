RAxML Bipartition Computation: Drawing support values from trees in file RAxML_bootstrap.consensusFULL_bootstrap onto tree in file RAxML_bestTree.consensusFULL


RAxML was called as follows:

raxmlHPC-PTHREADS -z RAxML_bootstrap.consensusFULL_bootstrap -t RAxML_bestTree.consensusFULL -f b -T 2 -m GTRGAMMA -n majority_rule_bootstrap_consensus 




Found 1 tree in File RAxML_bestTree.consensusFULL



Found 100 trees in File RAxML_bootstrap.consensusFULL_bootstrap
